You can enter 0 for no limit for this setting, but we do not necessarily recommend this, as most servers impose their own limitations for how many emails you are allowed to send per month. Continuously going over this limit could cause your server to permanent stop delivering emails from your installation. We suggest leaving a margin of at least 50 emails between your server's actual monthly limit and the monthly limit you set here. WP-Client cannot track all of the emails sent by all WordPress plugins and other web applications on your server, so this leaves a buffer to account for emails being sent by other plugins in your installation. If the monthly limit here is set to close to your server's hourly limit, some emails may go undelivered permanently."
