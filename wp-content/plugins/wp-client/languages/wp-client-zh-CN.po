You can choose to apply the default %1$s Template, use an already existing %1$s, or if you have created a separate WordPress Page you would like to use as a Template, you can choose that from the select-box. It's important to note that once a template is assigned to a %1$s, making changes to the master template will not affect the %1$s's template. You are essentially creating a \"copy\" of the Template when you create a new %1$s."
msgstr "您可以从这个菜单中创建一个新的 %1$s 。您可以将 %1$s 指定到 %2$s / %3$s，并利用模板选择框，您可以选择将一个 \"template\" 应用到新的 %1$s。 您可以选择使用默认的 %1$s 模板，使用一个已经存在的 %1$s，或者如果您已经创建了一个想做为模板使用的单独的WordPress网页，您也可以从选择框中选择它。要注意的是，一旦一个模板被指定到一个%1$s，对主模板进行修改不会影响 %1$s 's 的模板。当您创建一个新的 %1$s 时，您本质上是创建了一个 \"copy\" 的模板。"
